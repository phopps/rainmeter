Tip #65, pg. 212: Refactor Early, Refactor Often >> Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.
Tip #66, pg. 214: Testing Is Not About Finding Bugs >> A test is a perspective into your code, and gives you feedback about its design, api, and coupling.

Tip #86, pg. 268: Organize Fully Functional Teams >> Organize Around Functionality, Not Job Functions. Don't separate UI/UX designers from coders, frontend from backend, testers from data modelers, design from deployment. Build teams so you can build code end-to-end, incrementally and iteratively.
Tip #87, pg. 271: Do What Works, Not What's Fashionable >> Don't adopt a development method or technique just because other companies are doing it. Adopt what works for your team, in your context.
Tip #88, pg. 273: Deliver When Users Need It >> Don't wait weeks or months to deliver just because your process demands it.
Tip #89, pg. 274: Use Version Control to Drive Builds, Tests, and Releases >> Use commits or pushes to trigger builds, tests, releases. Use a version control tag to deploy to production.
